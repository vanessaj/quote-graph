# quote-graph
Graph visualization of quotes using D3.js

## Idea

Visualize connections between quotations from literature. Nodes represent a quotation and edges represent a shared genre / theme of the quote. Nodes wit h the same author are coloured the same.
Graph will be rendered using d3.js and use the force layout.
